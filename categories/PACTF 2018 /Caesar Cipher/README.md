Two hints in the description : the sentence and the red text

The red text looks like line numbers and word count from a text. But which text ? Let’s search the sentence on Internet. After so research I found that this is a sentence from The Tragedy of Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare.

So now that I know the text, I need to find it with line numbers. Here : [Link](https://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=juliuscaesar&Scope=entire&pleasewait=1&msg=pl)
