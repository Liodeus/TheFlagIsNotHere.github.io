Letâ€™s have a look at this note :

We have a gibberish note !

My first thought was to use xortool :

```
xortool -b emsg.txt
```
Go to the result folder, and search for the flag :

```
strings *|grep sctf{
```

That it we got it !

Flag : sctf{W1ll_U_571ll_du_4ll_0f_7h1s_1f_1_h4d_n07_s41d_4ny7h1ng?}
