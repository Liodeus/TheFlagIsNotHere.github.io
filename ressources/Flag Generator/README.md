## Introduction :

This tool can be very useful to have your final flag formatted and copied directly into your clipboard. 

## Usage :

### Change the value for the CTF name :

The first "replace" option allows you to replace the syntax of the CTF name which will then be saved when you restart the program.

### Have your final flag in your clipboard :

The second option allows you to have your final flag copied directly into your clipboard. You will only have to paste it directly on the site to get your points.
